White APP

## Problem

More and more Assets have become very unphysical due to the use of the internet in investing, saving files and correspondence.
While there was in prior times a physical folder filled with contracts, a land book or a statement from your bank there are nowadays emails in your inbox, crowdinvesting or oher investment accounts that one can access online.
It is therefore harder to have an overview on the Assets one owns, the contracts and documents attached to it and the relevant contractual partners.

Additionally it is almost impossible for the beloved ones overlive you to get a straightforward overview on the Assets and Obligations once you pass away.


## Solution

WhiteAPP will be a virtual vault that allows to store information on assets, contracts and contractual partners as well as on obligations and passive income (rent, dividends etcâ€¦).

WhiteAPP gives you an overview on those assets and gives you the security to have all relevant docs on the right place.
Additionally you can declare beneficiaries that can access your data (after a grace period to be defined) and get an overview in case you pass away.
